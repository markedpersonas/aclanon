Physical Appearance:
Middle-Eastern women often have olive, tan, or light brown skin, with dark brown or black eyes and hair. Hair texture can range from straight to curly or wavy. Some Middle-Eastern women may wear a hijab, which is a headscarf covering their hair, as part of their religious or cultural belief system.

However, Middle-Eastern women, especially those living in urban areas or outside of the region, can also be found wearing western-style clothing such as jeans, dresses, and skirts.

Culture and Religion:
The Middle East is a culturally diverse region, with many different languages, religions, and customs.
