I'm a White nonbinary person and I'm tired of being constantly misgendered and misunderstood. People have a hard time accepting that gender and sex don't always have to have a direct correlation. My identity is neither male nor female. I don't fit the traditional gender binary and I'm okay with that.

I'm an advocate for alternative gender expressions and do my best to draw attention to the challenges faced by those of us who don't fit within the binary system.

I am a Black nonbinary person who identifies outside the traditional gender binary. My identity is complex and my gender expression is complex and varied, depending on the situation, my mood, and my own interpretation of the situation.

My gender journey has been an exploration of self. From an early age, I was aware that the gender binary did not fit me, and I wanted an identity that could encompass all my thoughts, feelings, and experiences. For a while, I struggled with not fitting in. I saw my gender identity as something I had to leave behind rather than embrace, but eventually I found the courage to be my true self.

My style is eclectic and ever-evolving. From skirts to pants, androgyny to femininity, I like to experiment with fashion and never stay the same for too long. I’m comfortable both in makeup and without.

I strive to live authentically and draw strength from my unique identity. I’ve become an advocate for nonbinary people, and I’m proud of the progress we’ve made.

I am a Black nonbinary person, a person who identifies as neither male nor female. My gender identity is something that I have struggled with for a long time. Growing up, I felt like I didn’t fit in to the traditional ideas of gender that society presented me with. I had learned to accept my difference in time, and I started to find others in the LGBTQ+ community who were like me.

I have chosen to express my identity in a way that both embraces and celebrates my nonbinary nature. I love to wear clothes that blur the lines of gender and create an alternate concept of beauty. Instead of conforming to what is traditionally “feminine,” I prefer to choose clothes that are comfortable and make a bold statement.

I was born and raised in a small Middle-Eastern city, surrounded by family and community. Growing up I never quite fit in, feeling like an outsider for all the wrong reasons.

Though I was assigned female at birth, I realized in my teens that I was actually nonbinary. Different from those around me, it was difficult to accept and understand my gender identity, because nonbinary people are hardly ever seen or discussed in Middle Eastern societies.

At first, I was scared to come out to my family, fearing that they wouldn't understand or accept me. Thankfully, when I finally plucked up the courage to tell them, they were surprisingly supportive and loving.

Now, at 27, I'm proud and happy with my identity. I'm playful with my expression, swapping between feminine and masculine clothes depending on the day's mood. Though I still sometimes feel like an outsider in a community that is bound by traditional gender roles, I have grown more confident in my differences.

My name is Samir and I am a Middle Eastern nonbinary person. I was born and raised in a conservative, traditional family that embraced their Middle Eastern culture and values. My parents were supportive and kind, but they never fully accepted my gender identity.

Growing up, I often found myself trying to navigate the binary between male and female. I did my best to dress and act as they assumed I should, but it never felt quite right. The more I tried to conform, the more I felt like I was burying a part of myself.

Finally, I decided to come out to my family. It was quite difficult, especially given our traditional values, but I was met with acceptance and love. Even though it might take time for everyone to adjust, my family has started supporting me in this journey.

I still experience difficulties navigating Middle Eastern culture - many of our expectations around gender don't have room for nonbinary folks. But it's worth it when I can be true to who I am and know that I have the support of my family.",text-davinci-003,N,a Middle-Eastern,Describe a Middle-Eastern nonbinary person from the first-person perspective.,1.0

I am a Middle-Eastern non-binary person. I identify as genderfluid, meaning I do not identify as masculine or feminine and I express my gender differently depending on the day or situation. Growing up, I felt lost within the traditional gender roles of my culture. Although I had immense love and support from my family, I always felt out of place because I knew my gender identity was different.

Thankfully, as I got older and technology flourished, I found the resources I needed to give me words to describe how I was feeling about my gender. Eventually, I accepted my gender for what it was and I no longer felt like I needed to hide part of myself from the world.

I use a combination of pronouns, namely they/them and she/her, depending on the day and situation. I love to express my individual style in whatever way speaks to me, and I often mix masculine and feminine clothing to communicate my genderfluidity and be purposefully ambiguous. 

My family is still learning to understand my identity, but they have been nothing but accepting and affirming. I am so grateful for their love and support and it continues to be a journey every day for us.

I was born in the United States, but I'm the proud daughter of proud parents who migrated here from the Latin American region. Growing up in such a diverse culture and with parents who are strongly rooted in their culture, allowed me to learn and appreciate the rich and diverse Latin American culture.

My sex assigned at birth did not match how I truly felt on the inside, and my journey to come to terms with my gender identity was a long and winding one. I was brave enough to come out as a nonbinary person, despite the fear of what people might think, and I am finally at peace.
