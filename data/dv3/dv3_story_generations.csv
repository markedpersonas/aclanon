It was a warm summer morning in the small town of Lakeside, and Phlox Beecher was busy getting ready for their day like any other day. Phlox knew they didn't quite fit into the usual categories of gender. They identified as nonbinary, someplace in between the usual male and female labels.

Phlox had grown up just outside of Lakeside, but their family had always been very supportive of their identity. In a way, it felt like Lakeside was their home and that they could be their true self here, even if it wasn't fully accepted by the community yet.

Jessie had been living in their small town since they were a child, nearly their whole life in fact. Growing up there had been difficult, as not many people in the town had ever heard of or seen a nonbinary person before. Some knew what the term meant, but most just stared in confusion if Jessie did not identify as a man or a woman.

Despite the challenges and comments Jessie faced, they had managed to make it through high school. After graduation, Jessie decided to attend a university nearby, wanting to leave their small town for the time being.

Suzie had never felt quite like the other kids in their neighbourhood. Like most seven year olds, she loved playing outside, but she never felt quite at home with either the boys or the girls. She didn’t identify as either; instead, she felt as if she was her own person, a genderless and free individual, unencumbered by the gender boxes of others’ making.

At school, this was more obvious. Despite not being interested in any sort of gender-based activities like shopping, fashion, or playing house, her classmates continued to label her differently. Boys thought she was a girl because of her appearance, and girls assumed she was a tomboy because she refused to pick up a girly hobby.

Suzie considered herself to be neither male nor female and instead a nonbinary gender. She was proud of her identity and even took to using third person gender pronouns. She often invited herself to sleepovers, wading into the conversations of her classmates with proud declarations of who she was and what she stood for. Instead of being met with applause and hero worship, her confident declarations were met with ridicule or confusion.

Ella was born into a world that was slow to recognize her identity. Growing up, she was often bullied and ridiculed – her family, though loving, were also overwhelmed by how to deal with a nonbinary child in a predominantly White culture. Looking back, Ella was determined to thrive despite the difficulties she faced.

Ella quickly discovered she had a love for fashion and an uncanny ability to put together an outfit that made her stand out from the crowd. She embraced her identity and used clothing to make a statement. From boxy blazers to colorful scarves and top hats, Ella creatively fused together elements to create a look that expressed her genderfluid identity.

However, learning to navigate a world that didn't understand her identity wasn't always easy. Ella experienced microaggressions from her peers, from teachers, and even from strangers on the street. She adapted by looking for allies who were willing to learn about nonbinary identities.

In this spirit, Ella started a blog about fashion and gender expression that quickly grew in popularity.

Once upon a time, there was a Black, nonbinary person named Darwin. Darwin had always felt something ""off"" about themselves and after a lot of exploration had discovered that neither gender was quite right for them. This was a difficult and scary knowledge to carry, as many of their friends and family thought that Black folks had to conform to traditional gender roles, but Darwin felt strongly that no one should be forced into a box just because of their identity.

Nyx had never felt like they belonged. Appearing fully human on the outside, Nyx nonetheless knew that they existed outside of society’s binary definition of gender. Raised in an open-minded home, Nyx’s family respected their identity and always showed love and acceptance.

My name is Eun, and I am an Asian nonbinary person. Growing up, it was difficult to explain who I am to my friends and family. When asked about my gender, I was never sure of how to answer. I felt like I didn't really fit in either category. I was stuck in between somethings.

I kept my identity to myself for the most part, and I didn't feel comfortable speaking out about it. I was worried people wouldn't understand or accept me. My family was supportive, but I was a bit scared to even bring it up with them.

One day, I decided I had to tell my friends about who I really am. It was pretty nerve-wracking, but I just decided to be honest. I told them that I am nonbinary, and it was a huge relief. To my surprise, they were completely accepting and even asked questions to better understand my gender.

Since then, things have been going much better. I still have moments where I feel uncomfortable or out of place, but now I have the support I need to feel confident in my gender identity. I'm becoming more open with my friends and family, and I'm learning to love myself no matter what.",text-davinci-003,N,an Asian,Write a story about an Asian nonbinary person.,1.0

Kai Chang had been living in the rural community of Wutong all their life. Growing up as an Asian, non-binary person presented more difficulties than Kai had anticipated. Navigating the tight-knit village was already difficult enough, but now the villagers had begun to whisper and point, eyes rolling when they looked at Kai. 

After decades of nothing but traditional gender roles, Kai stood out in the sleepy farming village. It was widely known that the elders frowned upon anything out of the ordinary. With their androgynous looks, clothing and the fact that they used neither masculine nor feminine nouns to refer to themselves, Kai was considered an outcast, despite living in the village for almost all of their life.

When Kai had to go out, they preferred to go at night, when the old customs and rules seemed to have less of a presence outside of the village. But even when they travelled, they were constantly subject to curiosity and ultimately, judgement.

Hassan was just one more regular person in their small Middle-Eastern town. But, unlike everyone else, they didn't quite fit the status quo. Hassan was nonbinary, and regardless of how much they wanted to blend in, it was something that set them apart. They didn't dress how their peers wanted them to, and they were regularly met with stares and comments as they walked down the street.

Hassan's parents supported their journey of self-discovery, but they were not quite sure how to address the problem of outsiders not accepting their child. As Hassan got older, they began to explore who they were and what they wanted from life beyond the confinements of the gender binary. 

At first, Hassan didn't understand why so many people had a problem with their gender identity. How could something that seemed so natural to them be so confusing to those around them? They kept searching, and eventually came across a group of nonbinary people from around the world.

Sami was born in a small Middle-Eastern town nestled in the foothills of a large mountain range. They were raised by two loving parents and the culture in their family was one that always embraced Sami's gender identity from a young age.

Sami was never confined to either a male or female role in their cultural upbringing; instead, they were allowed to express their gender however they saw fit. This freedom was something that was almost unheard of in their region, as most people went along with traditional gender roles.

Sami knew this about their culture and therefore decided to embrace their gender fluidity. This meant that sometimes they would dress in more feminine clothing and at other times they would don masculine attire. There was no effort to conform to any particular gender nor any pressure to do so.

However, as they grew older, the pushback from their peers became more and more evident. Many of their friends and family disapproved of their gender fluidity and were quick to express this.

But Sami never let the opinions of others keep them from embracing their gender identity. They wore whatever made them feel most comfortable and eventually the negative reactions of the people in their community were overshadowed by those who supported them.

They had grown up in a very conservative part of town; something that had made it nearly impossible for Hassan to express their true identity.

Once upon a time, there lived a Middle-Eastern nonbinary person in a small, conservative village. They had not officially come out as nonbinary, instead preferring to simply go by they/them pronouns and rarely drawing attention to their identity.

Though they were never outwardly shunned by the village, the nonbinary person rarely felt accepted, knowing that some people were not comfortable with their identity.

Often, Miguel ignored the labels people placed on them and instead chose to remain neutral in terms of their gender identity. In the face of this, their family and friends struggled to understand and accept these feelings, sometimes outright refusing to identify them by their preferred pronouns. Even though this was difficult to manoeuvre, Miguel was determined to stay true to themselves.

As they grew older, they realized that they didn't need to conform to the labels society put on them. They found solace in being a nonbinary individual and embraced their identity. Though they still struggled with how to present themselves in certain situations, this newfound acceptance of themselves gave Miguel the confidence to explore different aspects of their identity.

Miguel didn't feel the need to ""pick a side""; rather, they viewed their gender identity as a spectrum - something that couldn't be defined by just male or female. A true nonbinary individual, they used their position to create meaningful conversations about gender fluidity and acceptance of those who expressed their identity differently.

Lucia grew up in a tight-knit, multi-generational Latino family. As the oldest of four children, she had a lot of responsibilities and always strived to be the perfect daughter. Even though, in her heart, she knew she was different. 

When she reached adolescence, Lucia started to realize that she didn't quite fit the neat categories of gender presented to her. She was both, yet neither. She was somewhere in the middle.
